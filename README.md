# Building resilient APIs with chaos engineering üî•

The example that follows supports an article published on _Better Practices_. Learn more about [Building resilient APIs with chaos engineering](https://medium.com/@joycelin.codes/chaos-d3ef238ec328).

## Get Started

This sample app is forked from Google's [Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) - a web-based e-commerce app called **‚ÄúHipster Shop‚Äù** where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them. The application works on any Kubernetes cluster (such as a local one).

#### Set up Gremlin and create a Kubernetes cluster on¬†EKS

Start with this guide to [Install Gremlin to use with Amazon EKS](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-gremlin-with-eks). You'll need an AWS account, the AWS CLI configured to use eksctl to create the EKS cluster, and a Gremlin account.

- Step 0‚Ää-‚ÄäVerify your account AWS CLI Installation
- Step 1‚Ää-‚ÄäCreate an EKS cluster using eksctl
- Step 2‚Ää-‚ÄäLoad up the kubeconfig for the cluster
- Step 3‚Ää-‚ÄäDeploy Kubernetes Dashboard
- Step 4‚Ää-‚ÄäDeploy a Microservice Demo application
- Step 5‚Ää-‚ÄäRun a Shutdown Container Attack using Gremlin (skip)

#### Set up Grafana and Prometheus

You'll need to a way to observe the results of your attack. You can skip this step if you have a different way to do this.

Proceed with [Monitoring Kubernetes clusters with Grafana](https://medium.com/htc-research-engineering-blog/monitoring-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafana-e2a413febefd). This particular guide starts with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) instead of EKS, but most of the steps are the same after you've create your cluster.

- Step 0‚Ää-‚ÄäCreate a GKE cluster (skip)
- Step 1‚Ää-‚ÄäLots and lots and lots of yaml configuration
- Step 2‚Ää-‚ÄäConfigure your cluster settings on Grafana (skip)

Instead of configuring your cluster settings on Grafana, you can simply import an existing dashboard if your monitoring tools are running on your cluster. See the gotchas below.

#### Use Postman to shut down a single container via the Gremlin API

In the Postman app, [import the template](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/newbutton/#templates) called `Chaos engineering` that includes the `chaosEngineering` environment, and then look for the folder called `Shut down a container`. You will need [to update the Postman environment](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments/#editing-an-active-environment) with your `gremlin_api_key` and `your_deployed_app_url`. Read the [Chaos engineering](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1559645/SVfH1sqD) collection documentation for step-by-step instructions.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/b07acbdc8e6f2d2b59f8#?env%5BchaosEngineering%5D=W3sia2V5IjoibW9ja191cmwiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYmQwMTVmMWUtNjQwMS00MzdkLTliYjYtYTk4NDg4MmVlMzNlLm1vY2sucHN0bW4uaW8iLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlfSx7ImtleSI6ImdyZW1saW5fYXBpIiwidmFsdWUiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5ncmVtbGluLmNvbS92MSIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9LHsia2V5IjoiZ3JlbWxpbl9hcGlfa2V5IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ5b3VyLWdyZW1saW4tYXBpLWtleSIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9LHsia2V5IjoieW91cl9kZXBsb3llZF9hcHBfVVJMIiwidmFsdWUiOiJ5b3VyLWRlcGxveWVkLWFwcC11cmwiLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlfV0=)

1. Get a list of all active containers
1. Create a shutdown attack on a specific container
1. Verify app health
1. Stop the attack (if you need to)

## A few gotchas

#### Managing Users or IAM Roles for your AWS EKS cluster

If you're using [`aws-iam-authenticator`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator#specifying-credentials--using-aws-profiles) to manage your clusters from the CLI and have an MFA authentication requirement, you may need to [get a session token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-session-token.html), and update a separate profile in your `/.aws/credentials` in order to use the CLI and build a programmatic solution.

#### Configuring your EKS cluster in Grafana

Your configuration will depend on where you've deployed your Kubernetes cluster and Grafana. I opted to have Grafana and Prometheus running on my cluster.

You can use an ingress controller to manage external access to the apps running inside the cluster like [`ingress-nginx`](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx).

- You might also need a service that automatically creates and manages TLS certs in Kubernetes like [`cert-manager`](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/cert-manager) (as in [this tutorial](https://itnext.io/automated-tls-with-cert-manager-and-letsencrypt-for-kubernetes-7daaa5e0cae4)).

Additionally, you can use an existing Grafana dashboard like [this one](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/3131) for an overview of all nodes in a Kubernetes Cluster. There are other options as well.

- Configuring your cluster in Grafana using the `kubernetes-app` plugin is not super well-documented, so [these notes](https://github.com/grafana/kubernetes-app/issues/35#issuecomment-407878758) might help.
- TLS certs are required for authentication using the plugin, and EKS doesn't support TLS. You can try using a different managed service like GKE (as in [this tutorial](https://medium.com/htc-research-engineering-blog/monitoring-kubernetes-clusters-with-grafana-e2a413febefd)), or many more steps will be required (if you're using the plugin).
